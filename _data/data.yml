This section can give potential employers a better idea of your personality, your values, and your interests beyond your professional experience.

    Including an interest section in your resume can be helpful if your interests are relevant to the job you are applying for, such as if you are applying for a job in a creative field and your hobbies include painting or writing. It can also be useful if you are applying for a job where teamwork or social skills are important, and you can mention interests that demonstrate those qualities.

    In this section, you can highlight your achievements, areas of expertise, and any unique qualities or experiences that set you apart from other candidates. You can also mention areas where you are looking to improve or gain further experience.

    A well-crafted self-evaluation section can demonstrate your self-awareness and confidence in your abilities, as well as your willingness to continuously learn and grow. However, it is important to be honest and avoid over-inflating your skills or qualifications, as this can negatively impact your credibility and the hiring manager's impression of you.

reference:

  order: 14
  title: References
  description: |
    A reference section in a resume is a list of individuals who can vouch for your skills, work ethic, and character. These individuals are typically former managers, colleagues, or mentors who have worked closely with you in the past and can provide insight into your abilities and work style.

    It's important to note that including a reference section in a resume is not always necessary, and some employers may prefer to request references separately. If you do choose to include a reference section, it should typically be located at the end of your resume.

    When listing references, be sure to include the individual's name, job title, company name, phone number, and email address. It's also a good idea to ask for the individual's permission before listing them as a reference, and to let them know what kind of job you are applying for so they can speak to your relevant skills and experience.

    It's important to choose references who can provide a positive and comprehensive evaluation of your work. Avoid listing family members or friends as references, and instead focus on individuals who can speak to your professional abilities and accomplishments.
